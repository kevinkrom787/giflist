## About the project
Todo lists suck and haven't changed in hundreds of years. Plus, I always lose mine behind browser screens and end up getting side tracked.  

### goal: 
Make todo lists fun & visible. 

## How to use
1. Clone repo
2. Turn on developer mode in Chrome - chrome://extensions/ (toggle button on in the top right)
3. Open new tab and start adding todos!


### Need to add:
- Counter ++/-- to the number of tasks in local storage.
- Function that celebrates removing tasks
- Add a styling
- Render the counter on the page to show how much work is being done.
