## About the project
Todo lists suck and haven't changed in too long. Plus, I always lose mine behind browser screens and end up starting over with a new list. 

### goal: 
Make todo lists fun & visible. 

## How to use
1. Clone repo.
2. Turn on developer mode in Chrome - chrome://extensions/ (toggle button on in the top right).
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left & select the "Giflist" file.
4. Open new tab and start adding todos!


### Need to add:
- Counter ++/-- to the number of tasks in local storage.
- Function that celebrates removing tasks.
- Add a styling.
- Render the counter on the page to show how much work is being done. 
- Get some feedback.
